##Software engineering is a discipline of creating high quality software products using principles, tools and methodologies. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power and facilitates different faculties of everyday life.
##Development of programming languages, The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, a rise in agile methodologies in the 2000s
##Requirements- scope of the needs and requirements of the solution that will be created Designing - high level detailed design of the architecture of the software that it to be created. Developing - the process ofcreating th software using coding tools,languages, etc. Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. Deployment - relesing the created software for users to utilize Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.
##Waterfall is sequential and has distinct phases flowing through the software development life cycle rigidly and with no room fr changinges once the development process has started. Agile is incremental and iterative and is flexible in allowing changes n the development process.
##Software developer codes and creates the software product. Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans. Project Manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects
##IDEs are platforms where softwares code is written, debugged, and tested. eg Visual Studio VCS track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members, eg GIT
## Changing requirements - always having meetings to recap and updates on environmental changes and obstacles. utilizing Agile methodolgy Tight deadlines - having clear reasonable timeline expectations uncompromised Technical debt - emphasize on quality assurance engineering to reduce suboptimal solutions and shortcuts.
## unit testing of individual components integration testing of different components and how they interact together system testing whereby the whole system including components and units. Acceptance testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
##prompt engineering is using clear concise text to prompt a response from a chatbot. this is to get more accurate information quicker
## "what is the weather today?" is a vague prompt. "what is the weather forecast in Johannesburg today?" This narrows down the answers to location specific data.
