Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline of creating  high quality software products using principles, tools and methodologies. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power and facilitates different faculties of everyday life. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages, The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, a rise in agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-  scope of the needs and requirements of the solution that will be created
Designing -  high level detailed design of the architecture of the software that it to be created.
Developing - the process ofcreating th software using coding tools,languages, etc.
Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - relesing the created software for users to utilize
Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is sequential and has distinct phases flowing through the software development life cycle rigidly  and with no room fr changinges once the development process has started.
Agile is incremental and iterative and is flexible in allowing changes n the development process.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer codes and creates the software product.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are platforms where softwares code is written, debugged, and tested. eg Visual Studio
VCS track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members, eg GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements - always having meetings to recap and updates on environmental changes and obstacles. utilizing Agile methodolgy
Tight deadlines - having clear reasonable timeline expectations uncompromised
Technical debt - emphasize on quality assurance engineering to reduce suboptimal  solutions and shortcuts.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing of individual components
integration testing of different components and how they interact together
system testing whereby the whole system including components and units.
Acceptance testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is using clear concise text to prompt a response from a chatbot. this is to get more accurate information quicker

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"what is the weather today?" is a vague prompt. "what is the weather forecast in Johannesburg today?" This narrows down the answers to location specific data.
